- 2-print_dog.c: Prints the values of the "name", "age", and "owner" members of a "dog" structure.
- 4-new_dog.c: Allocates memory for a new "dog" structure and initializes its members with the given values.
- 5-free_dog.c: Frees the memory allocated for a "dog" structure.

 "name", type "char *"\
 "age", type "float"\
 "owner", type "char *" 


## void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner)

Initializes the members of a "dog" structure with the given "name", "age", and "owner" values.

## void print_dog(struct dog *d)

Prints the values of the "name", "age", and "owner" members of a "dog" structure.

## dog_t *new_dog(char *name, float age, char *owner)

Allocates memory for a new "dog" structure and initializes its members with the given "name", "age", and "owner" values.

## void free_dog(dog_t *d)
